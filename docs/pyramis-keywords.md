### ðŸ“– Components of a Pyramis Specification
<details>
<summary> <strong>Interface file</strong></summary>
  The <strong>interface file</strong> is a json file that describes the architecture of your multi-tier system in terms of individual nodes and their <ins>interface descriptions</ins>.
  The interface file has a <a href="https://github.com/armaanchowfin/pyramis/blob/master/examples/login-system/interfaces.json">fixed format </a>, enforced by the compiler. 
  Among other configuration options, it specifies peer nodes and protocols which are used by the compiler to validate the flow of message `SEND`s, and also help in the subsequent generation of the platform file.

### ðŸ“Œ Pyramis Syntax
Pyramis defines keywords that are used to specify various kinds of user-level message processing actions. They can be broadly categorised as follows:
<details>
<summary> <strong>Context Actions</strong></summary>
 Pyramis supports the notion of contexts that store application state. Contexts are always persistent
 and are stored in <code>std::map<></code> as specified by the user.
 
 <code>STORE(__in_map_name, __at_map_key, __at_map_struct_attribute, __value)</code>
 <ul>
  <li>The <strong>STORE</strong> action is used to indicate storage of a value in a map. </li>
  <li>In Pyramis, every map has an associated map struct that contains every attribute specified to be accessed or stored in it.</li>
 </ul>

 <code>LOOKUP(__and_store_in_ident, __from_map_name, __key, __attribute_of_map_struct)</code>
</details>

<summary> <strong>Message and Information Element (IE) Actions</strong></summary>

<summary> <strong>Logical Actions</strong></summary>

<summary> <strong>Special Actions</strong></summary>

### ðŸ“– Requirements for compilation to executable NF

Pyramis keywords can flexibly represent key aspects of most multi-tier systems. However, to compile to a working implementation, certain constraints have to be imposed on the inputs and outputs.
  
<details>
<summary> <strong>Well-Defined L-7 protocol library</strong></summary>
  Pyramis supports multitier systems using the NGAP and HTTP L-7 protocols out of the box. However, rolling your own application-layer protocol would have to meet certain requirements: 

- Valid messages for custom protocols must be implemented as complete C/C++ structs. These files may be stored in a `utils` directory in the your root folder.
- HTTP messages must represent and access their payload strings as attributes of nlohmann::json objects. We provide an HTTP library for this purpose.
- All char arrays are interpreted as C++ `std::vector<char>`. Strings, if any, must be null-terminated.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <strong>Platform-file + Processing-file architecture</strong></summary>
  Where a platform file triggers kernel networking actions, and the processing file performs user-level message-processing actions

- In the current implementation, a C++ user-level processing file is generated from the Pyramis specification.
- In the current implementation, a multithreaded, asynchronous epoll-based platform.cpp file is generated that declares an entry point into the user-level processing code.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <strong>Notion of procedure key</strong></summary>
  The NF must generate a unique procedure key for each instance of procedure. Procedure may be simple (login request-response) or complex (SMF session-establishment). Complexity arises due to the requirement of demultiplexing messages received at a single interface to the correct message handler. The notion of "key" and its supporting `fd_to_key_map` and `key_to_fd_map` are implementation-specific constructs that enable this message demultiplexing.

- `procedure_key` is used by the NF application to maintain a synchronous message-processing flow despite asynchronous message ingress at an NF
- A single NF independently initiates procedure requests.
