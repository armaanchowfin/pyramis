# Pyramis
**Pyramis** is a Domain-Specific language that enables you to specify multi-tier systems of variying complexities with minimal ambiguity:

Quick start
===========

#. **Version** your data and models.
   Store them in your cloud storage but keep their version info in your Git repo.

#. **Iterate** fast with lightweight pipelines.
   When you make changes, only run the steps impacted by those changes.

#. **Track** experiments in your local Git repo (no servers needed).

#. **Compare** any data, code, parameters, model, or performance plots.

#. **Share** experiments and automatically reproduce anyone's experiment.
